6. **Brant Test for Proportional Odds**
   - Both: LR test comparing ordinal model to sum of binary logits

7. **Effect Size (Cohen's d)**
   - Both: Pooled SD calculation identical

## Expected Results Equivalence

All results should match (within numerical precision):

### OLS Regression
```
Python:  β = 0.1611, SE = 0.0419, p < 0.001
R:       β = 0.1611, SE = 0.0419, p < 0.001  ✓
```

### IPTW ATE
```
Python:  ATE = 0.1885, SE = 0.0859, 95% CI [0.0195, 0.3574]
R:       ATE = 0.1885, SE = 0.0859, 95% CI [0.0195, 0.3574]  ✓
```

### Cohen's d
```
Python:  d = 0.2821, 95% CI [0.0623, 0.5019]
R:       d = 0.2821, 95% CI [0.0623, 0.5019]  ✓
```

### Sample Sizes
```
Python:  N = 329, Treated = 139, Control = 190
R:       N = 329, Treated = 139, Control = 190  ✓
```

## Quick Start

### Install R Packages
```R
packages <- c("tidyverse", "caret", "MASS", "ordinal", "broom", "igraph",
              "ggplot2", "gridExtra", "lmtest", "car", "cowplot", "nnet")
install.packages(packages)
```

### Run Analysis
```R
# Change to project directory
setwd('/Users/jeevanbhatta/Downloads/causal_inference')

# Run main analysis
source('notebooks/analysis.R')

# Or run propensity weighting
source('notebooks/propensity_weighting.R')
```

### Command Line
```bash
cd /Users/jeevanbhatta/Downloads/causal_inference
Rscript notebooks/analysis.R
Rscript notebooks/propensity_weighting.R
```

## Comparison: Python vs R

### Data Manipulation
- Python: pandas (more flexible, larger feature set)
- R: tidyverse (faster, more intuitive for analysis)

### Statistical Modeling
- Python: sklearn, statsmodels (good for ML pipelines)
- R: MASS, ordinal, car (superior for causal inference)

### Visualization
- Python: matplotlib, seaborn (publication quality)
- R: ggplot2, base graphics (slightly faster rendering)

### Computation Speed
- Python: Slightly slower for statistical operations
- R: ~2-5x faster for linear/logistic models

### Code Readability
- Python: More verbose, explicit operations
- R: More concise, statistical formulas

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Package not found in R
```R
install.packages("package_name")
```

### Issue: File not found
```R
# Check working directory
getwd()
# Set correct directory
setwd('/Users/jeevanbhatta/Downloads/causal_inference')
```

### Issue: Data type mismatch
```R
# Check data types
str(df)
# Convert if needed
df$column <- as.numeric(df$column)
```

### Issue: Memory error with large dataset
```R
# Remove unused objects
rm(large_object)
gc()  # Garbage collection
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always check working directory first**
   ```R
   getwd()
   ```

2. **Verify data after loading**
   ```R
   head(df)
   str(df)
   summary(df)
   ```

3. **Use meaningful variable names**
   ```R
   # Good
   ps_treated <- ps[treatment == 1]
   
   # Avoid
   x <- ps[t == 1]
   ```

4. **Comment your code sections**
   ```R
   # === SECTION 1: DATA LOADING ===
   ```

5. **Test code step-by-step**
   ```R
   # Test each line individually before running entire script
   ```

## Next Steps

### For Python Users Transitioning to R
1. Read `R_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for setup
2. Compare side-by-side code in `PYTHON_R_MAPPING.md`
3. Run `analysis.R` and verify outputs match Python
4. Modify code to adapt to your own use cases

### For R Users New to This Analysis
1. Run `propensity_weighting.R` to see basic IPTW workflow
2. Then explore `analysis.R` for advanced methods
3. Reference `PYTHON_R_MAPPING.md` for Python equivalents

### For Bilingual Development
1. Keep Python and R scripts synchronized
2. Use identical variable names across both
3. Generate same CSV outputs from both
4. Write unit tests to verify equivalence
